# steganography-Secure-Communication
For the purpose of the project we analysed several steganography algorithms both from the spatial and
transform domain techniques and we implemented 2 algorithms namely:
a) A New Secure Image Transmission Technique via Secret-fragment-visible Mosaic Images by Nearly-reversible Colour Transformations
b) A Novel Image Stenographic Technique using Fast Fourier Transform
We then carried out StegAnalysis on the image obtained from each of these algorithms. The results revealed the algorithm (a) to be the better out of the 2 , which we implemented in our final application .
This project can be divided into 4 main parts:
  > Analysis & comparison of existing steganography methods.
  > Implementation of selected algorithms
  > Testing for robustness against detection
  > Implementation of the encryption algorithm
  > Development of an application
